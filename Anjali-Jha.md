## Bio

My name is Anjali Jha and I am a 2nd-year undergraduate. I am a web developer and take an interest in competitive coding as well. DSC NSEC has been a constant source of learning and motivation for me since the time it was formed. The members are always the happiest to help even when in the smallest of problems and this is exactly the kind of environment where one grows and prospers.
